# Spotify_Clone
This **Spotify Clone** is a frontend-only project built with **HTML and CSS**, replicating Spotifyâ€™s UI. It features a **dark theme, popular albums, playlists, and a user library**. Fully responsive but lacks backend functionality. Future updates may include JavaScript interactivity and backend integration.
